# Artwork and sound sources

The built-in image generation tool created `source-atlas.png` for this game.
`prepare-atlas.cjs` crops its cells, swaps the two leaning poses, resizes with
nearest-neighbour sampling and packs horizontal strips. It does not draw the
artwork. Run it with Node.js and the optional `sharp` asset-preparation package.
Neither Node nor sharp is a game runtime dependency.

The generated sheet contains two dream creatures, golden seeds, four flower
species and sparse garden accents. Dreamers have four poses each. Flowers have
two frames each. `images/steel8x8.png` is copied unchanged from the SDK's
`games/demos/tutorial_game/images/steel8x8.png`.

`make_audio.py` synthesizes the original bloom chime and a 32-second soft loop
from sine tones and encodes them with FFmpeg. Run it with host Python 3 and
FFmpeg to rebuild the two MP3s. These files follow the repository's GPLv3
license alongside the sample code. No external music or sampled recording is
used.

## Generation prompt

Create a production-ready transparent pixel-art SPRITE ATLAS for an experimental circular arcade game called Dream Garden. Exact layout: EIGHT equal columns and FOUR equal rows, a 2:1 horizontal image. Each cell contains one separate centered sprite with generous transparent padding. No visible grid lines, letters, numbers, labels, background, shadow beneath objects, or scene. Strict low resolution pixel art: chunky crisp square pixels, limited pastel mint/lavender/pink/amber palette with deep navy outlines, no antialiasing style or gradients. Intended to read at 19x19 pixels. ROW ONE all 8 cells: a tiny rounded dream creature with two eyes and soft leafy antennae. Cells 1-4 pink creature, neutral face, leaning left, leaning right, sleeping with closed eyes. Cells 5-8 same creature in mint blue, same four poses. ROW TWO cells 1-4: one floating golden seed/wisp in four subtle animation phases, simple bright core and a little tail; cells 5-8 entirely empty transparent. ROW THREE all 8 cells: four distinct dream flowers, TWO frames per flower with petals open slightly differently. Flower species: pink star blossom, mint fern blossom, lavender moon flower, amber glowing mushroom flower. ROW FOUR all 8 cells: eight tiny sparse dream garden accents on transparency: a mint root curl, a pink petal pair, a lavender crescent, three tiny amber stars, a blue sprout, a mint leaf, lavender bubbles, a single pink curl. All objects completely contained within their individual cells, exact consistent spacing. Cozy strange playful dream imagery for a festival about dreaming and rest. No spacecraft, weapons, robots, metal, UI, logos, or text. Export on genuine transparent background.
